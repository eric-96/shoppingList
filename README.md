# shoppingList

This is a Shopping List exercise by MDN Web Docs which I completed and further incremented with:

-The ability to press Enter to add a grocery to the list. Having to click the button everytime s*cks!
-An event listener that keeps the focus -always on- on the input so I don't ever need to click on it.
